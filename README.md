# moviewatchers

## About

**moviewatchers** is a proof-of-concept app built to practice **Go** and **React + TypeScript**. It
provides a simple interface for organizing and playing videos stored locally on a userâ€™s device.

With user approval, the app scans specified local storage to create a web page displaying available
videos for easy access and playback. This project is purely educational, focusing on improving
coding skills and providing a better way to enjoy locally stored content.

# moviewatchers

## About
The incentive for this project is to learn **Go** and **React + TypeScript** by solving the problem of watching movies and shows on websites with low graphic and audio quality. Instead, **moviewatchers** accesses user's memory storage, with approval, populating a web page with all movies and shows. This gives easy access and playback of all user favorite videos locally on their machine.
